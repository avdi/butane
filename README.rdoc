== Butane

A nod to the Propane for mac which monitors Campfire rooms.  This is for Linux
users.  It has been tested on Ubuntu 8.10 and should work on Debian based
systems just fine.

=== Requirements

 * Ubuntu 8.10 (or later, I'd assume)
 * the tinder gem (1.2.0):  sudo gem install tinder
 * libnotify-bin: sudo apt-get install libnotify-bin

I use the Gnome desktop and I'm not sure about the requirements for
libnotify-bin above.

=== To Dos

 * Package as a gem although it is pretty specific to linux and possibly the
   gnome desktop as well.
 * Add :ignore: regex to ignore certain patterns on a per-room basis
 * Daemonize.

=== Configuration of the .butanerc

Create a .butanerc in your home directory.  It's in yaml format and here's what
it looks like:

    --- 
    mycampfire: 
      :login: rick@email.com
      :password: mypassword
      :rooms: 
        First Room: 
          :sticky: rick
        Git Commits: 
          :sticky: models|specs

    otheraccount:
      :login: rick@email.com
      :password: someotherpassword
      :rooms:
        Light is Nice:
          :sticky: rick

    
Fixed keywords in the above:

 * :login:
 * :password:
 * :rooms:
 * :sticky:

The rest of the items, "mycampfire", "otheraccount", "First Room" and "Git
Commits", "Light is Nice" are the names of your accounts and rooms in those
account.

As you've guessed by now, it does work with multiple campfire accounts.

There is the "First Room".  Any activity that regexp matches /rick/i will pop
up a sticky notification that needs to be clicked away.  Ditto for the "Light
is Nice" room.
    
In the "Git Commits" room, any activity that matches the regexp /models|specs/i
will again cause a sticky notification to appear.

=== Run it

butane.rb &

If it can't login to an account, that will be shown on stdout.  If a room
cannot be found, that will also be shown on stdout.
